using regular expressions(Ctrl+Shift+F):
^:b*[^:b*#/{}]+.*$

temp note:
rendering subsystem need a GetCurrentFrameTime, and a GetDelta

technique loading with macro

pipeline scrpit


add a no channel framebuffer, for compute shader or something with out fragment shader
texture parameter should not allow nullptr


bufferTexture do not use sampler

multi-thread?
framebuffer / how to set channels from shader?

TODO:

create new texture constructor without 2 dimension data parameter, remove constructor parameter generateMipmap of the one with 2 dimension data parameter
light base class, light shader and it's interface, material shader and it's interface
the shading process that use light shader and material shader

optional:
change all enum cast to use: ValueFromEnum, EnumFromValue
how to make a dll that can work correctly?
(now have a lot of warning about stl class and may have some other warning, and exe using this dll cannot work)
thread for logic/rendering call generation/rendering api calls
using input device capture to do input event generation, refactor Window to subclass device interface.
