util -> util & graphics type

rework type checking mechanisms for TechniqueParameter in Material & Technique

shader interface struct:
	variable(common base for attribute, uniform buffer, shader rsource buffer)
	attribute
	texture uniform
	image uniform
	uniform buffer
	shader resource buffer
	atomic buffer
	output
framebuffer desc contain a output
shader interface information structs contain corresponding information struct

XML format:
	include
	Pipeline state
	attribute
	uniform(texture, image)
	uniform buffer
	shader resource buffer
	atomic buffer
	output
	common code(no tag)
	stage code(with tag)



bufferTexture do not use sampler

multi-thread?
framebuffer / how to set channels from shader?

TODO:

create new texture constructor without 2 dimension data parameter, remove constructor parameter generateMipmap of the one with 2 dimension data parameter
effect file / format
effect loading with macro
effect interal intermediate texture variable
light base class, light shader and it's interface, material shader and it's interface
the shading process that use light shader and material shader

optional:
change all enum cast to use: ValueFromEnum, EnumFromValue
how to make a dll that can work correctly?
(now have a lot of warning about stl class and may have some other warning, and exe using this dll cannot work)
thread for logic/rendering call generation/rendering api calls
using input device capture to do input event generation, refactor Window to subclass device interface.
